<h3>Differences between remove and detach jQuery methods</h3>
<p><span class="code">$(element).remove()</span> removes the matched
  elements from the DOM completely including events associated with
  the matched elements.</p>
<p><span class="code">$(element).detach()</span> is like <span
  class="code">remove()</span>, but keeps the stored data and events
  associated with the matched elements.</p>
<p><span class="code">$(element).hide()</span> sets the matched
  elements' CSS <span class="code">display</span> property to
  <span class="code">'none'</span>.</p>
